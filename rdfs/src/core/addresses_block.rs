//! # RDFS AddressesBlock Module
//!
//! This module defines the `AddressesBlock` structure used to store public keys
//! representing participating nodes in the RDFS virtual drive.
//!
//! Each `AddressesBlock` includes:
//! - A dynamic list of `Address` entries (typically 32-byte public keys)
//! - A final 64-byte `Signature` used for authentication or integrity verification
//!
//! The `AddressesBlock` is stored immediately after the `SuperBlock` and is
//! essential for drive-level identity management, quorum verification, or
//! consensus-based validation among nodes.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Compact, length-prefixed encoding of node public keys
//! - Fixed-size, signature-terminated layout
//! - Strict size checks to ensure determinism and forward compatibility
//! - Manual signature attachment for ZK/STARK-friendly workflows
//!
//! ## Encoding Layout
//! ```text
//! [8 bytes: length][32 bytes * N: addresses][64 bytes: signature]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Design Goals
//! - Keep representation flat for efficient I/O
//! - Separate cryptographic responsibilities from data structure
//! - Maintain byte compatibility across node implementations
//!

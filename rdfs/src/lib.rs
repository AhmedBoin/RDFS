//! # Rust Distributed File System (RDFS)
//!
//! A simple distributed file system written in Rust.
//!
//! The main advantage of this type of virtual file system is
//!     1. zero copy/move contents (like delete in any file system).
//!     2. no fragmentation due to semi-linked list structure (linked list for arrays of data blocks).
//!     3. continues linked drivers as a one big driver.
//!     4. high throughput and low latency R times where R is the redundancy where you could
//!         receive file chunks in different nodes in parallel.
//!     5. resistance to cyber attacks like DoS/DDoS...etc.
//!     6. unstoppable due to it's nature of distribution across different nodes also this nodes
//!         could be operate under NATs, Relays or TorVPN.
